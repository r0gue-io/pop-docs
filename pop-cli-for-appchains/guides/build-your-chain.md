# Build your chain

To build your chain using Pop CLI

```shell
cd my-chain
pop build
```

```
┌   Pop CLI : Building a chain
│
   Compiling parachain-template-runtime v0.1.0 (/Users/pop/src/my-chain/runtime)
   Compiling parachain-template-node v0.1.0 (/Users/pop/src/my-chain/node)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 1m 20s

└  Build Completed Successfully!
```

If you are outside the project's directory, you can specify the path

```shell
pop build -p ./my-chain
```

If you are building the chain with the intent to onboard to a Polkadot Relay chain then you can run the following build command:

```
pop build -p ../my-chain --para_id 2000
```

This command will build your chain and generate the chain spec, the WebAssembly runtime, and generate the chain genesis state needed for registering and onboarding onto the Relay chain.
