  The following will guide developers on how to run a command after launch of
  your network.

# Running a post-startup command

Often there is a use case to run a command (or script) upon network initialization.

Say you want to fund accounts on your appchain or run a command to check account balances, Pop CLI allows you to do this via the `--cmd` option that is included in the `pop up network` command:

```
pop up network --help
```

To run a command post-initialization of the network, you can use the `--cmd` flag:

```bash
pop up network -f ./tests/networks/pop.toml --cmd path/to/command
```

Here is an example of a simple script to update account balances on the Polkadot Relay chain:

[https://github.com/brunopgalvao/set-balance](https://github.com/brunopgalvao/set-balance/blob/main/src/main.rs)

Clone and compile the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brunopgalvao/set-balance
cd set-balance
cargo build
```

Create a simple zombienet network.toml file to spin up the Polkadot Relay chain:

```bash
touch network.toml
```

```toml
[relaychain]
chain = "paseo-local"

[[relaychain.nodes]]
name = "alice"
rpc_port = 8833
validator = true

[[relaychain.nodes]]
name = "bob"
validator = true
```

Spin up the Polkadot Relay chain with Pop CLI:

```
pop up network -f network.toml -r v1.8.0 --cmd ./target/debug/set-balance
```

```

Pop CLI has spun up the Polkadot network and executed the post-startup script.

Alice's account has not been funded!
