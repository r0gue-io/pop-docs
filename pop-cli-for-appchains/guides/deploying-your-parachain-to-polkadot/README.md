# Launching your Parachain on Polkadot

A typical development workflow for launching your parachain on Polkadot:&#x20;

* Run your parachain **locally** using Pop CLI.&#x20;
  * Under the hood, Pop CLI launches your parachain to Paseo Local TestNet automatically for development purposes:
    * [Run your parachain on Paseo](../running-your-parachain.md)
* When ready to test your parachain in a live environment with other parachains:
  * Use [this guide](../running-on-paseo-locally.md) to mimic the manual onboarding process for Paseo TestNet locally.&#x20;
  * When comfortable with manually onboarding locally, then use the next guide to onboard to Paseo Live TestNet.
    * [Launching your parachain on Paseo TestNet](../launching-your-parachain-on-polkadot/launching-on-paseo.md)
* Finally, when thoroughly tested on Paseo, launch on Polkadot
  * The process here is similar to launching on Paseo.
