# Onboarding your Parachain to Polkadot

A good development workflow:&#x20;

1. Run your parachain **locally** using Pop CLI to onboard your parachain to Paseo TestNet automatically for development purposes:
   * [ ] [Run your parachain on Paseo](../running-your-parachain.md)
2. When ready to test your parachain in a live environment with other parachains:
   * [ ] Use [this guide](running-on-paseo-locally.md) to mimic the onboarding process for Paseo TestNet locally.&#x20;
   * [ ] When comfortable with onboarding locally, then use the [next guide](running-on-paseo.md) to onboard to Paseo Live TestNet.
