# Launch a Chain in Development

To run your parachain, you will need to spin up a local network with your parachain configuration.

The `pop up` command can help with this.

```shell
pop up network --help
```

{% hint style="info" %}
For Pop CLI versions <`0.7.0` the `pop up network` command is `pop up parachain`
{% endhint %}

Say we want to spin up a local network for your parachain. First we need to define a [zombienet](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet) network configuration file. You can do this in the root of your project.

```
cd my-appchain
touch network.toml
```

Add the following configuration, adapting as necessary.

> You can use `paseo-local` for your Relay chain. Paseo is the community-led Polkadot Test Relay chain.

```toml
[relaychain]
chain = "paseo-local"

[[relaychain.nodes]]
name = "alice"
validator = true

[[relaychain.nodes]]
name = "bob"
validator = true

[[parachains]]
id = 2000
default_command = "./target/release/parachain-template-node"

[[parachains.collators]]
name = "collator-01"
```

> This network configuration will launch a relay chain using a `paseo-local` instance of Polkadot with two validator nodes to run the network: `alice` and `bob`. It will also run `parachain-template-node` with one collator node named `collator-01`.

Cool. Let's spin this up, ensuring that your parachain binary has been built using `pop build parachain`.

```shell
pop up ./network.toml
```

If this is the first time you are running the `pop up` command, it will prompt you to source the required Polkadot binaries. This will take some time, grab some coffee.

Once all the binaries are sourced, you should have output similar to this.

```

```

Congrats! You have now spun up a network with your parachain running!

> Under-the-hood, Pop CLI uses zombienet to spin up the network.\
