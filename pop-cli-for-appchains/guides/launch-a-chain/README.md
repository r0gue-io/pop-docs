# Launch a chain on Polkadot

A typical development workflow for launching a chain on Polkadot:&#x20;

1. [Launch a Development Network](running-your-chain.md) with predefined chains.
2. [Launch a Known Chain](launch-a-known-chain.md)
3. [Launch a Chain on Paseo](launch-a-chain-to-paseo.md).
4. [Deploy a Chain With Polkadot Deployment Portal](deploy-a-chain-polkadot-deployment-portal.md).
5. Launch a Chain on Polkadot (same as Paseo).
