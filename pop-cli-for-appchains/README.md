With Pop CLI, developers can build solutions for Polkadot via:

### Appchains

* Build: start a new parachain project using starter templates to hit-the-ground running
  * Templates include Standard, Assets, Contracts and EVM
* Test: test a parachain by running unit and integration tests
* Deploy: deploy a parachain to a local network

Pop CLI also enables you to quickly spin up a Polkadot network along with various parachains.
