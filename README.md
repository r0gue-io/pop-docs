# Pop

The Pop Platform (Pop) is a developer platform for Web3 solutions on Polkadot.

Pop consists of two main products: Pop CLI and Pop Network.

## Pop CLI

GitHub: [https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-cli](https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-cli)

An all-in-one tool for Polkadot development.&#x20;

Pop CLI provides an on-ramp for development on Polkadot by providing a simple command line interface for quickly creating, building, testing, and deploying a Polkadot solution - whether smart contract or complete Polkadot chain (parachain).

Learn how to develop with Pop CLI:

* [Chains](pop-cli-for-chains/README.md)

### Installing Pop CLI

See [Install Pop CLI](installing-pop-cli.md) for full instructions on installing Rust, Cargo, and Pop CLI for your platform.

## Pop Network

GitHub: [https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-node](https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-node)

Pop Network is the answer to: "How do I deploy a smart contract on Polkadot?".

Pop Network is a Polkadot smart contract platform. Developers can write smart contracts and use the DOT token to deploy their smart contracts to Pop Network.

Furthermore, Pop Network has a bright roadmap full of features to take what were previously Polkadot chain-level features and hoist these features to the smart contract level so smart contract developers can harness the full-power of Polkadot in their smart contracts.&#x20;

### Roadmap

2025 is the Year of Interoperability.
