# Pop

Pop is the platform for building powerful Web3 solutions on Polkadot with Rust.

It transforms the complex landscape of Polkadot development into an effortless and powerful experience, whether you're developing a chain or smart contract. Pop is crafted to be the simplest, fastest, and most intuitive way to bring your ideas to life on Polkadot.

Pop is made up of two essential components that work hand-in-hand:

## Pop CLI

GitHub: [https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-cli](https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-cli)

An all-in-one tool for Polkadot development.

Pop CLI provides an on-ramp for development on Polkadot by providing a simple command line interface for quickly creating, building, testing, and deploying a Polkadot solution; Polkadot chain or smart contract

Install the Pop CLI and start building:

* [Chains](https://learn.onpop.io/v/appchains)
* [Smart Contracts](https://learn.onpop.io/v/contracts)

## Pop Network

Pop Network is the answer to: "How do I deploy a smart contract on Polkadot?".

Pop Network is a Polkadot smart contract platform. Developers can write smart contracts and use the DOT token to deploy their smart contracts to Pop Network.

Furthermore, Pop Network has a bright roadmap full of features to take what were previously Polkadot chain-level features and hoist these features to the smart contract level so smart contract developers can harness the full-power of Polkadot in their smart contracts.

### Roadmap

2025 is the Year of Interoperability.
