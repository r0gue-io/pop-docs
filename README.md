# Pop

The Pop Platform (Pop) is a developer platform for Web3 solutions on Polkadot.

Pop consists of two main products: Pop CLI and Pop Network.

## Pop CLI

GitHub: [https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-cli](https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-cli)

An all-in-one tool for Polkadot development.

Pop CLI provides an on-ramp for development on Polkadot by providing a simple command line interface for quickly creating, building, testing, and deploying a Polkadot solution - whether smart contract or complete Polkadot appchain (parachain).

Install the Pop CLI and start building:

* [Smart Contracts](https://learn.onpop.io/v/contracts)

## Pop Network

Pop Network is the answer to: "How do I deploy a smart contract on Polkadot?".

Pop Network is a Polkadot smart contract platform. Developers can write smart contracts and use the DOT token to deploy their smart contracts to Pop Network.

Furthermore, Pop Network has a bright roadmap full of features to take what were previously Polkadot appchain-level features and hoist these features to the smart contract level so smart contract developers can harness the full-power of Polkadot in their smart contracts.

### Roadmap

2025 is the Year of Interoperability.
