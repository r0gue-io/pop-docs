An all-in-one tool for Polkadot development.&#x20;

Pop CLI provides an on-ramp for development on Polkadot by providing a simple command line interface for quickly creating, building, testing, and deploying a Polkadot solution - whether smart contract or complete Polkadot appchain (parachain).

## Pop Network

GitHub: [https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-node](https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-node)

Pop Network is the answer to: "How do I deploy a smart contract on Polkadot?".

Pop Network is a Polkadot smart contract platform. Developers can write smart contracts and use the DOT token to deploy their smart contracts to Pop Network.

Furthermore, Pop Network has a bright roadmap full of features to take what were previously Polkadot appchain-level features and hoist these features to the smart contract level so smart contract developers can harness the full-power of Polkadot in their smart contracts.&#x20;
