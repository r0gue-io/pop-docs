# Pop

The Pop Platform (Pop) is a developer platform for Web3 solutions on Polkadot.

Pop consists of two main products: Pop CLI and Pop Network.

## Pop CLI

GitHub: [https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-cli](https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-cli)

An all-in-one tool for Polkadot development.&#x20;

Pop CLI provides an on-ramp for development on Polkadot by providing a simple command line interface for quickly creating, building, testing, and deploying a Polkadot solution - whether smart contract or complete Polkadot appchain (parachain).

## Pop Network

GitHub: [https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-node](https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-node)

Pop Network is the answer to: "How do I deploy a smart contract on Polkadot?".

Pop Network is a Polkadot smart contract platform. Developers can write smart contracts and use the DOT token to deploy their smart contracts to Pop Network.

Furthermore, Pop Network has a bright roadmap full of features to take what were previously Polkadot appchain-level features and hoist these features to the smart contract level so smart contract developers can harness the full-power of Polkadot in their smart contracts.&#x20;

### Roadmap

**August**&#x20;

* Pop API Assets Pallet&#x20;
  * Use the Pop API to interact with the assets pallet of Pop Network.

**September**&#x20;

* Asynchronous Contracts&#x20;
  * Facilitate cross-chain dispatch and read state information back to the contract.

**October**

* Pop API Cross Chain Use Case&#x20;
  * Use Pop API to interact with other chains.

**November**

* Programmable DAO&#x20;
  * Implementation of an ink! programmable DAO pallet allowing quick creation of DAOs and custom logic.
* Audits, finalizing the Pop Network runtime, Bulk Coretime implementation, and improvements to Pop API cross-chain use cases.

**December** ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ…

* Launch Pop Network, integration with subscan.
