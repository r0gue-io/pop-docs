With Pop CLI, developers can build solutions for Polkadot via:

### Contracts

* Build: start a new ink! smart contract project
* Test: test an ink! smart contract, including unit and end-to-end tests
* Deploy: deploy an ink! smart contract locally or to a live network

### Parachains

* Build: start a new parachain project using starter templates to hit-the-ground running
    * Templates include Standard, Assets, Contracts and EVM
* Test: test a parachain by running unit and integration tests
* Deploy: deploy a parachain to a local network

Pop CLI also enables you to quickly spin up a Polkadot network along with various parachains.
