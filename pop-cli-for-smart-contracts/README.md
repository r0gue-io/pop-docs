# Build Polkadot Smart Contracts with Rust

<img src=".gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="Smart Contracts" style="max-width: 400px;">

Polkadotâ€™s native smart contract language, [ink!](https://use.ink/), makes it simple to create powerful decentralized solutions with Rust. Tap into Polkadotâ€™s unmatched security, multichain composability, and seamless access to native chain features through precompiles.
- Start building with the [ink! documentation](https://use.ink/docs/).

> **ðŸš€ New:** Pop CLI introduces experimental support for ink! v6 on [PolkaVM](https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm). See [Getting Started with ink! v6](./guides/getting-started-with-inkv6.md) to try it out.
