With Pop, developers can develop smart contract solutions for Polkadot.

### Features include:

* Building a new smart contract
* Testing your smart contract, including unit and end-to-end tests
* Deploy your smart contract locally or to production

> **ðŸš€ New:** Pop CLI introduces experimental support for ink! v6 on [PolkaVM](https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm). See the [migration guide](./guides/migrating-to-inkv6.md) to get started.
