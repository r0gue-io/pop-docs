# Create a new contract

To create a new ink! smart contract using Pop CLI, run the following command, specifying the name of the contract:

```shell
pop new contract flipper
```

> Note: 'flipper' has been used as the name above as the default template is based on the `flipper` contract example.
> Additional contract templates will be added in the next release!

You should get output like the following:

```
â”Œ   Pop CLI : Generating new contract "flipper"!
â”‚
â—‡  Smart contract created! Located in the following directory "/flipper"
â”‚
â””  cd into "flipper" and enjoy hacking! ðŸš€
```

You can now `cd` into the folder and start hacking on your contract:

```shell
cd flipper
```

You should see the directory structure of your ink! smart contract:

```
flipper
  â””â”€ lib.rs
  â””â”€ Cargo.toml
  â””â”€ .gitignore
```
