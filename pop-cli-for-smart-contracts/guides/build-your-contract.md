# Build

Before we compile your smart contract, make sure to take a look at what an ink! contract consists of in the [documentation](https://use.ink/docs/v6/getting-started/building-your-contract).&#x20;

To build your ink! smart contract, make sure you are inside your ink! smart contract directory and run the following command:

```shell
pop build
```

or

```
pop build --release
```
