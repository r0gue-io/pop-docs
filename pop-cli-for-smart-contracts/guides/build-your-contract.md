# Build

> ðŸš€ **Note:** For experimenting with ink! v6, make sure to check [getting-started-with-inkv6.](../welcome/migrating-to-inkv6.md)

To build your ink! smart contract, make sure you are inside your ink! smart contract directory and run the following command:

```shell
pop build
```

or

```
pop build --release
```

The Pop CLI uses `cargo-contract` under the hood, for more information read [`compile your contract`](https://use.ink/docs/v6/getting-started/building-your-contract) from the ink! documentation.
