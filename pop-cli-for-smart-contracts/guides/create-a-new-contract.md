# Create a new contract

> **⚠️ Note:** For experimenting with ink! v6, make sure to check [getting-started-with-inkv6](./getting-started-with-inkv6.md).

To view all available smart contract templates with Pop CLI, run:

```bash
pop new contract --template
```

To create a new ERC20 contract, run:

```bash
pop new contract my_erc20 --contract-type erc --template erc20
```

Then open the generated `my_erc20` directory to start developing your contract.
