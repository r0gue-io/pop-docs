# Create a new contract

> ðŸš€ **Note:** For experimenting with ink! v6, make sure to check [getting-started-with-inkv6.](../welcome/migrating-to-inkv6.md)

To view all available smart contract templates run:

```bash
pop new contract --template
```

To start a new contract, e.g. ERC20, run:

```bash
pop new contract my_erc20 --contract-type erc --template erc20
```

Then open the generated `my_erc20` directory to start developing your contract!\
