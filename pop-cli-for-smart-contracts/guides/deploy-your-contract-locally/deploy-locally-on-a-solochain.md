# Deploy your contract locally

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This guide supports ink! v5 by default. For experimenting with ink! v6, please refer to our [migration guide](../getting-started-with-inkv6.md).

Make sure your contract builds.

```sh
cd flipper
pop build
```

For all available options run: `pop build --help`

When deploying a smart contract you need to know how much gas is needed so you can pay accordingly. More info on this topic can be found here:

* [https://use.ink/basics/gas](https://use.ink/basics/gas)

To find an estimate of how much gas you will need, you can do a "dry-run" of the contract:

```
pop up --constructor new --args false --suri //Alice --dry-run
```

{% hint style="info" %}
For Pop CLI versions <`0.7.0` the `pop up` command is `pop up contract`
{% endhint %}

This will perform a dry-run via an RPC call to estimate the gas usage. It does not submit a transaction.

```
‚îå   Pop CLI : Deploy a smart contract
‚îÇ
‚óá  Gas limit estimate: Weight { ref_time: 146346224, proof_size: 16689 }
```

You can now see the estimate and make sure your account is properly funded with that amount.

We can now deploy the contract locally, meaning that we will upload and instantiate the contract.

> It is also possible to **only** upload the contract and **not** instantiate by adding `--upload-only`

```
pop up --constructor new --args false --suri //Alice

‚óá  The chain "ws://localhost:9944/" is not live. Would you like pop to start a local node in the background for testing?
‚îÇ  Yes

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** If you're using ink! v6, the contract address displayed here will appear as a 20-byte hash.

> Note: The contracts node will be running in the background of your machine. If at anytime you need to kill the process you can do the following:
>
> 1. Find the process ID by running the following command: `lsof -i :9944`
> 2. Kill the process by running the `kill` command and passing in the ID of the process:
>    * [`kill -9 3537`](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

Your contract is now deployed! You can check in [PolkadotJs Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/) as well.
