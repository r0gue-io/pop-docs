# Deploy your contract locally

There are two paths to deploy your contract locally:

1. Spin up an ink! compatible solochain for smart contract development
2. Spin up Pop (a Polkadot parachain) locally for ink! smart contract development

Both options are fine for local ink! smart contract development.

To develop cross-chain messaging features (which are inherent to Polkadot) and to use Pop API, you will need option 2: Deploy locally on Pop.
