# Build your parachain

To build your parachain using Pop CLI

```shell
cd my-chain
pop build
```

{% hint style="info" %}
For Pop CLI versions <`0.3.0` the `pop build` command is `pop build parachain`
{% endhint %}

```
┌   Pop CLI : Building a parachain

```

If you are outside the project's directory, you can specify the path

```shell
pop build -p ./my-chain
```

{% hint style="info" %}
For Pop CLI versions <`0.3.0` the `pop build` command is `pop build parachain`
{% endhint %}

If you are building the parachain with the intent to onboard the parachain to a Polkadot Relay chain then you can run the following build command:

```
pop build -p ../my-chain --para_id 2000
```

This command will build your parachain and generate the chain spec, WebAssembly runtime for the parachain, and generate the parachain genesis state needed for registering and onboarding a parachain onto the Relay chain.
